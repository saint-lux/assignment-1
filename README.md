Over time, to streamline it as well as to make it more accessible to the public, the company went through a SPAC (special purpose acquisition company) merger to expand their products. In 2021, SoFi went officially public on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Market for public funding where investors can freely purchase their stocks. (1)(3)


## Business Activities

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
    > SoFi is one of the early leaders in providing financial solutions that were not previously available through apps or your phone. Thus, their main focus is to make everyday finance more accessible with a simple tap or click of the mouse. SoFi is now an all in one, purely online platform provider of fintech solutions.

    >SoFi is offering an all encompassing financial product range under one platform (online banking, direct investing, mortgage options, crypto trading, refinancing, etc.).
